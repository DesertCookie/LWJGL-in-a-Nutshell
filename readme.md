**Important Note:** This repository is due to be split up into several new repositories that will house GitBooks and code about [**Vulkan**](https://github.com/DesertCookie/Vulkan-in-a-Nutshell), [**GLFW**](https://github.com/DesertCookie/GLFW-in-a-Nutshell), and [**OpenAL**](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenAL-in-a-Nutshell). This repository will be transformed to exclusively feature guides about **OpenGL**. *Links will become functional as repositories become available.*

## About this Repository
This repository contains **tutorials and code about game development** with **OpenGL 3.3+** in Java using **LWJGL 3**. The articles available in the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki) are not only applicable to Java and can be used to get into OpenGL in other 
programming languages too.<br>
Topics covered are universal topics like [Window Creation](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/Creating-a-Window) using GLFW 
or rendering using [Vertex Array Objects](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/VAOs), but also more difficult ones like 
[Rendering Text](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/Bitmap-Fonts), graphical user interfaces or procedurally generating 
terrain.

This series is **not only for beginners** that have little to no prior 3D and 2D game development experience but is also **geared towards more 
experienced programmers** looking for a different angle on doing game development with OpenGL or just wanting to learn about a still unknown aspect.
<br>
The articles can be read one-by-one or in succession meaning you don't have to read through literally 20 articles when you only want to know how to 
retrieve [Gamepad Input](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/Gamepad-Input) using GLFW.<br>
Please keep in mind that this series is progressing kind of slowly and not all articles - especially about more complicated topics - are available 
just yet.

There is a [full list of tutorials](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki) available over in the wiki section. 


If you are more of a person that likes watching tutorials, I plan on releasing all articles featured in the wiki in video form on my YouTube channel 
[DesertCookie](https://youtube.com/channel/UC8CEjPeMC6YjffzQv2q7dcA). If you ever have problems with OpenGL or just want feedback visit the 
[Coding Wastelands Discord Server](https://discord.gg/C9eu6FB).<br>
Following many techniques shown in this series I created my own open source game engine which you can check out 
[here](https://github.com/DesertCookie/JOnion).
