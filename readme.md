## About this Repository
This repository contains **tutorials and code about game development** with OpenGL in Java using LWJGL. The articles available in the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki) are not only applicable to Java and can be used to get into OpenGL in other 
programming languages too.<br>
Topics covered are universal topics like [Window Creation](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/Creating-a-Window) or 
rendering using [Vertex Array Objects](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/VAOs), but also more difficult ones like 
[Rendering Text](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/Bitmap-Fonts) or graphical user interfaces.

This series is **not only for beginners** that have little to no prior 3D and 2D game development experience but is also **geared towards more 
experienced programmers** looking for alternatives on solving known problems or just wanting to learn about one unknown aspect.<br>
The articles can be read one-by-one or in succession meaning you don't have to read through literally 20 articles when you only want to know how to 
retrieve [Gamepad Input](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki/Gamepad-Input) using GLFW.


If you are more of a person that likes watching their tutorials, I plan on releasing them in video form on my YouTube 
channel [DesertCookie](https://youtube.com/channel/UC8CEjPeMC6YjffzQv2q7dcA) that's focused around programming and especially game development 
related topics.

There is a [full list of tutorials](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki) available over in the wiki section. If you have 
problems with OpenGL or just want feedback visit the [Coding Wastelands Discord Server](https://discord.gg/C9eu6FB) that also is the community 
server of my YouTube channel.
