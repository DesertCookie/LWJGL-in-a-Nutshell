## OpenGL LWJGL Tutorial
**OpenGL tutorial series** in Java using the Lightweight Java Gaming Library introducing you into the concepts of game engine development with 
OpenGL, OpenAL and GLFW.<br>
The source code to every article is freely available in this repository and can be freely modified and used (see the 
[license](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/blob/master/license.txt)). While the source code is in Java the tutorials in the 
[Wiki](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki) also apply to **other languages**, as LWJGL keeps all native calls as similar to 
their C source as possible.

In this series I go over topics like window creation and basic rendering using OpenGL's old immediate but, but also more advanced topics like VAOs 
and VBOs, and font and GUI rendering.

I plan on releasing every article as video over on my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UC8CEjPeMC6YjffzQv2q7dcA) channel, if you are more into 
learning by watching.

There is a [full list of available tutorials](https://github.com/DesertCookie/OpenGL-LWJGL-Tutorial/wiki) over in the wiki with more articles to 
come. If you have problems with OpenGL or just want feedback visit the [Coding Wastelands Discord Server](https://discord.gg/C9eu6FB).
